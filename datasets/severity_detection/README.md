# Severity Detection Dataset

## Purpose
Train a model to detect severity level (Minor, Moderate, Severe, Hazardous) from images

## Folder Structure
- `Minor/` - Minor damage images
- `Moderate/` - Moderate damage images
- `Severe/` - Severe damage images
- `Hazardous/` - Hazardous/dangerous damage images

## Severity Levels

### Minor
- Small scratches
- Cosmetic issues
- Slight wear
- Non-functional impact

### Moderate
- Noticeable damage
- Some functional impact
- Requires repair but not urgent
- Visible wear/deterioration

### Severe
- Significant damage
- Major functional impact
- Requires immediate attention
- Extensive wear/damage

### Hazardous
- Safety risk
- Immediate danger
- Exposed hazards
- Critical failures
- Could cause injury

## How to Add Images

1. Place images in the appropriate severity folder
2. Use clear, well-lit images that show the damage level
3. Filename format: `severity_item_description_001.jpg`

## Minimum: 30 images per severity level
## Recommended: 100+ images per severity level
