# Raw Images Directory

## Purpose
Store original, unprocessed images before organizing them into training datasets

## Usage

1. **Dump all collected images here first**
2. **Review and organize** images into appropriate category/priority/severity folders
3. **Keep originals** as backup in case you need to reorganize

## Organization Workflow

1. Collect images → Place in `raw/`
2. Review images → Categorize them
3. Move to appropriate folders:
   - `category_classification/[Category]/`
   - `priority_prediction/[Priority]/`
   - `severity_detection/[Severity]/`

## Tips

- Don't delete images from `raw/` until you're sure they're properly organized
- Use this as a staging area
- Can create subfolders in `raw/` for temporary organization
