# 🎓 Smart College Damage Reporting - Review Demo Script

Use this script to present your project tomorrow. It highlights the "Wow" factors we added.

## 🌟 Key Talking Points
1.  **AI-First Approach**: "We don't just report damage; we understand it using Computer Vision."
2.  **Smart Workflow**: "The system automatically prioritizes issues to help facility managers."
3.  **Modern UX**: "A premium, responsive interface that students will actually want to use."

## 🎬 Demo Flow

### 1. The "Magic" Moment (Complaint Submission)
*   **Action**: Go to the User Dashboard and click **"+ New Complaint"**.
*   **Say**: "When a student reports an issue, we want it to be effortless."
*   **Action**: Upload an image of a broken chair (or any test image).
*   **FEATURE**: Point out the **"AI Predictions"** button.
*   **Action**: Click "Get AI Predictions".
*   **Observe**:
    *   The **Scanning Animation** (The "Wow" factor).
    *   The delay (adds a sense of "processing").
    *   The **Result Card**: "Look! It detected 'Chair', assigned 'Medium Priority', and even wrote the description for me!"

### 2. The "Command Center" (Admin Dashboard)
*   **Action**: Log out and log in as Admin.
*   **Say**: "Facility managers need a bird's-eye view, not just a list."
*   **Observation**:
    *   Show the **Stats Grid** (Total Reports, Pending, etc.).
    *   Show the **Interactive Charts** (Category Bar Chart & Priority Doughnut Chart).
    *   Scroll down to the **Table View**: "We replaced the clunky cards with a professional data table."
    *   Demonstrate **Filters**: "I can instantly see only 'High Priority' issues."

### 3. The Tech Stack (If asked)
*   **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS (Custom Premium Theme).
*   **Backend**: Node.js + Express.
*   **AI Engine**: Python (FastAPI) + MobileNet/ResNet (CNN).
*   **Database**: MongoDB.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap (To sound progressive)
"We are currently working on Phase 3: Automated Work Orders, where 'High Severity' issues automatically dispatch a maintenance request via Email/SMS."
